Exercises

1. How are integers stored on a computer?

    The integer types have a definite size. They are uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64, int8,
    int16, int32, and int64. 8, 16, 32, and 64 tell us how many bits each of the types
    use.

2. We know that (in base 10) the largest one-digit number is 9 and the largest two-digit
   number is 99. Given that in binary the largest two-digit number is 11 (3), the largest
   three-digit number is 111 (7) and the largest four-digit number is 1111 (15), what's
   the largest eight-digit number? (Hint: 10^1 - 1 = 9 and 10^2 -1 = 99)

    The largest eight-digit number is 11111111 (255)

3. Although overpowered for the task, you can use Go as a calculator. Write a program that
   computes 32,132 x 42,452 and prints it to the terminal (use the * operator for
   multiplication).

   package main

   import "fmt"

   func main() {
        fmt.Println("32,132 x 42,452 =", 32132*42452)
   }


4. What is a string? How do you find its length?

   A string is a sequence of characters with a definite length used to represent text. Go
   strings are made up of individual bytes, usually one for each character. 

   To find the length of a string: len("sequence of characters")

5. What's the value of the expression (true && false) || (false && true) || !(false &&
   false)?

   Expression           Value
   ---------------------------
   true && false        false
   false && true        false
   false && false       false
   !(false && false)    true

   (true && false) || (false && true) || !(false && false) = false || false || true = true
